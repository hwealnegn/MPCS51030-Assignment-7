Grade: 8/10

Good job overall! 

Detail view controller should not be editable

UIWebView starts looking like its loading once the app is launched for the first time, but there is no request in progress

Also, behavior without internet is not ideal - web view has loading screen and looks like it's loading info even though it's not

Can't leave bookmark view controller in iPhone

No additional point included for iPhone popover
